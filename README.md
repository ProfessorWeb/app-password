Thank you very much for purchasing the product.
I invested a lot on this system for your comfort and for it to be as dynamic as possible.

installation guide

1. Go to the config.js file and change the settings you want.
2. To run the site just drop the files on your host. I use https://www.netlify.com/.
3. Not mandatory, but it is highly recommended to use npm run build and then upload your website to the host.

Settings Email

1.  Register at https://www.emailjs.com/
2.  Click on Account and take the API keys from there and put in config.js
3.  Click on Email Templates Then click Create new Template and insert the template in the template.md file.
4.  Click on Email Templates again Then copy your Template ID.
5.  Click on Email Services. Choose your desired email. Then copy its Template ID.

Copy everything I said.
Must be inserted into the config.js file as written.

for your attention,
This system will be sold for a very limited time.
Only the buyers who managed to buy the system can enjoy it.
After that you will no longer be available for purchase.
